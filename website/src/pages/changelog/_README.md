This folder contains the changelog

The changelog is generated by running `npm run changelog` from the root of the docs2.0 project.

We create two sets of files:
* a file for every release (minor / patch). (These are in `_versions`).
  * Once a file is created, it's not modified, so you can safely modify it.
  * Except for `_versions/next.md`, which is ALWAYS overwritten
  * These files serve as the input into the changelog aggregator.
  * These files are not served
* An aggregate of files per minor version, which bundles all the patches together
  * These are appended to each time the build is run.

Unreleased changes are appended to `_versions/next.md` and `releases/next.mdx` accordingly.
This is ALWAYS overwritten.


 - _versions are the raw files output by changelog-generator.
   - These files aren't modified by scripts once created, making it safe to clean them up once the script has run
   - They serve as the input into changelog-aggregator
   - next is ALWAYS overwritten
   - this directory is not served
 - `releases/` contains the aggergated pages - the output of changelog-aggregator
   - We bundle minor and patch versions together
