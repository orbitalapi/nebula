 * [Kafka / S3 / Postgres](https://github.com/orbitalapi/demos/blob/main/s3-postgres-kafka/orbital/nebula/stack.nebula.kts) - The first one we wrote - a Nebula script as part of an [Orbital Demo](https://github.com/orbitalapi/demos/tree/main/s3-postgres-kafka)
 * [Working with Kafka](https://github.com/orbitalapi/demos/blob/main/working-with-kafka/orbital/nebula/stack.nebula.kts) - Slightly more complex example - multiple Kafka topics with co-ordinated messages simulating updates from a fake food delivery service - part of another [Orbital demo](https://github.com/orbitalapi/demos/tree/main/working-with-kafka)
